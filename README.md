# Deep-Learning-FashionMNIST

A machine learning project for classifying fashion images using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to train a model that can accurately recognize different types of clothing items such as shirts, shoes, bags, and more.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to classify grayscale images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into one of 10 fashion categories. It serves as a practical exercise in model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset

The [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset but with images of clothing items.  
- 60,000 training images  
- 10,000 test images  
- 10 classes:  
  0. T-shirt/top  
  1. Trouser  
  2. Pullover  
  3. Dress  
  4. Coat  
  5. Sandal  
  6. Shirt  
  7. Sneaker  
  8. Bag  
  9. Ankle boot

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch / Keras *(choose the one you used)*
- scikit-learn

## Model Architecture

*(Example: for a simple CNN)*  
- Input layer: 28x28 grayscale image  
- Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)  
- Max Pooling Layer  
- Dropout  
- Fully Connected Layer (Dense)  
- Output layer with softmax activation

## Results

- Training accuracy: ~XX%  
- Test accuracy: ~XX%  
- Loss and accuracy plots are available in the notebook/results folder.

*(You can also include a confusion matrix or sample predictions here.)*
